# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualisation

Graph traversal pathfinding algorithms visualised in Python using Tkinter. Algorithms include Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*.
Think of a graph as a network of nodes. Types of graphs include logistic or road networks, IP routing and GPS coodinates.

## Breadth First Search

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root, and explores all neighbour nodes at the current level before proceeding to the nodes on the subsequent level.

## Depth First Search

Depth-first search (DFS) starts at the root node and explores the current branches extremeties before backtracking.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

## A* Algorithm

A* algorithm improves the Dijkstra process by including extra information through a heuristic function that determines which paths to explore next.
